# PhpCRud
This is my web course project at university.
The project involves managing user accounts through PHP CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with the admin role. The implementation includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and PHP.
It allows the admin to perform actions such as updating, deleting, viewing, and creating user accounts
